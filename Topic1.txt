Topic 1: Introduction to API Automation
Subtopic a: Manual vs. Automated Testing â€“ Differences & Benefits
ðŸ”¹ Manual API Testing (Using Postman)
âœ” Testers manually send requests & check responses.
âœ” Good for quick exploratory testing.
âœ” Not efficient for large-scale or repetitive testing.

ðŸ”¹ Automated API Testing (Using Rest Assured)
âœ” Tests are written as code and executed automatically.
âœ” Ensures repeatability, speed, and accuracy.
âœ” Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ“Œ Example Scenario:
âœ… If an API has 50 endpoints, testing them manually will take time.
âœ… Automation can test all 50 endpoints quickly & consistently.

Subtopic b: Importance of API Automation
âœ” Fast Execution â€“ Automated tests run much faster than manual ones.
âœ” Consistency â€“ Eliminates human errors in testing.
âœ” Scalability â€“ Can handle large test suites.
âœ” Integration â€“ Can be part of DevOps & CI/CD.
